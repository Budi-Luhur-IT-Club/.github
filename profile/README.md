## Overview

Budi Luhur IT Club or commonly called BLIC is a community engaged in the field of Information Technology. The reason BLIC was established was due to the lack of learning support in the field of Information Technology in developing the interests and talents of Budi Luhur University students. Because of this, BLIC is present as a forum to facilitate students in developing their potential in the field of Information Technology. BLIC focuses on learning case studies or real projects with the hope that students can compete in the industrial world while understanding professional workflows.
